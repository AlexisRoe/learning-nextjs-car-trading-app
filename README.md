in this repo I follow the tutorial by [Bruno Antunes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU0mNYdX9EHY7rc5yucIZA) The video course you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSZyzpwBEWSQsrukurP09ksi49H9Yj40). In the end there will be a car trading app, showing all the features of the tutorial. Afterwards you find my learnings.
